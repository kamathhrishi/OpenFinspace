# OpenFinSpace

**An open-source workspace where investment analysts team up with AI as a co-worker to supercharge financial research and craft investment theses.**

OpenFinSpace is your AI-powered partner for investment analysis, designed for financial analysts, researchers, and investors. Imagine having a brilliant co-worker who dives into financial data (e.g., SEC filings, earnings calls, news), uncovers insights, and helps you build data-driven strategies‚Äîall within a customizable workspace. With an intuitive UI and flexible API, OpenFinSpace makes AI your ally in navigating the complexities of investment research.

> **Note**: OpenFinSpace is a developer-friendly tool for building and testing investment research workflows. Swap demo data (e.g., Yahoo Finance) with premium sources for production-grade analysis.

## Features (Coming Soon)
- **Collaborative UI**: A workspace with a search bar and results page, featuring filters (e.g., date, company, sector) to explore data alongside AI.
- **API for Teamwork**: Endpoints to query data and integrate AI insights into your financial tools or workflows.
- **AI Co-Worker**: Plug in AI to summarize filings, analyze news, or generate investment ideas, working hand-in-hand with you.
- **Demo Mode**: Test the workspace with sample Yahoo Finance data to see AI in action.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Swap data sources (e.g., mock data, premium APIs) or tailor the UI to fit your research style.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies (coming soon!)

### Demo Setup
Demo setup instructions coming soon! Stay tuned for a sample workspace to explore OpenFinSpace with Yahoo Finance data, showcasing AI as your research partner.

> **Warning**: Yahoo Finance data will be for demonstration only and may be incomplete, delayed, or unreliable for professional use. For robust analysis, use premium sources like SEC EDGAR, FactSet, or Refinitiv.

### Customization

## Example Use Cases

## Limitations
