# OpenFinSpace

**An open-source workspace for AI-assisted investment research, empowering analysts to query financial data and formulate investment theses.**

OpenFinSpace is a customizable platform designed for financial analysts, researchers, and investors. Think of it as *Cursor for investment research*: leverage AI to explore financial data (e.g., SEC filings, earnings calls, news), analyze trends, and build data-driven investment strategies. With an intuitive UI and flexible API, OpenFinSpace streamlines your research workflow.

> **Note**: OpenFinSpace is a developer-friendly tool for building and testing investment research workflows. Swap demo data (e.g., Yahoo Finance) with premium sources for production-grade analysis.

## Features (Coming Soon)
- **Search UI**: Intuitive search bar and results page with filters (e.g., date, company, sector).
- **API Layer**: Endpoints for querying data and integrating with AI models or financial tools.
- **AI Assistance**: Plug in AI to summarize filings, analyze news, or generate investment insights.
- **Demo Mode**: Test with sample Yahoo Finance data to explore the workspace.
- **Modular Design**: Easily swap data sources (e.g., mock data, premium APIs) or add custom AI integrations.
